# Dotfiles, etc.

I keep my configuration files on Dropbox, since it is usually one of the first apps I install on a new computer. If I tweak something on one computer, Dropbox pushes it to any other computers I use, making it easy to keep things in sync. Originally inspired by [Mathiasâ€™s dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles), with a lot of copy and pasting from Google.

## Usage

* For a new computer, install Dropbox and run `setup.sh`
* For subsequent changes, run scripts manually or cherry-pick changes
